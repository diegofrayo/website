# Project Setup

This skill automates the initial setup of a new project through 5 sequential steps.

## Steps

| # | Name | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | initial-setup | Base project with TanStack Start, pnpm, Tailwind CSS, and core dependencies |
| 2 | typescript-setup | TypeScript v6+ with strict `tsconfig.json` |
| 3 | eslint-setup | ESLint flat config with JS, TS, React, and CSS rules |
| 4 | prettier-setup | Prettier with import-sorting and Tailwind plugins |
| 5 | husky-setup | Husky + lint-staged pre-commit hook |

## How to run

For each step in order:

1. Ask: "**Step N: `<step-name>`** — <description from table above>. Do you want to execute this step? (yes/no)"
2. If **yes**: read `references/N-<step-name>.md` and follow its instructions exactly.
3. If **no**: skip and move to the next step.
4. After all steps, summarize what was executed and what was skipped.
