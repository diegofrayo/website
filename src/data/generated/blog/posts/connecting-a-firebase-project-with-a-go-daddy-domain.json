This website is hosted on\n\t[Vercel](https://vercel.com).\n</Callout>\n\nIn this tutorial I want to explain how to connect a **Go Daddy** domain with a **Firebase** project.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **Node.js**\n- A **Go Daddy** domain\n- A **Firebase project**\n\n## Connecting our Firebase project with the Go Daddy domain\n\n1. Go to `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/[YOUR-PROJECT-ID]/hosting` and click on **Connect a domain**\n\n1. Now, you should see a modal, where you have to type the domain's name, for example: `diegofrayo.com`, and then click on **Continue**\n\n1. It's necessary to verify you are domain's owner, so, you have to create a **TXT record** on the domain's configuration on **Go Daddy**. To accomplish it, log into **Go Daddy** and go to `https://dcc.godaddy.com/manage/[YOUR-DOMAIN.COM]/dns`. Now, you have to create the **TXT record** using the information that Firebase provides you and wait until **Firebase** verifies that you are the domain's owner. _(I had to wait around one hour)_\n\n   > **IMPORTANT:** To create a **TXT Record**, it is required to enter a _Host_. **Firebase** proposes to use our domain's name as _Host_, for example `diegofrayo.com`. I **didn't** use my domain's name as _Host_, instead, I used the `@` symbol\n\n1. After **Firebase** verifies that the domain is yours, you have to create the **A records** using the information that Firebase provides. To do this, you have to go to the domain's configuration on **Go Daddy** and create them the same way that you have created the **TXT records** in the steps above. Before create them, it is important to delete all **A records** that you have created formerly\n\n   > **IMPORTANT:** To create an **A record**, it is necessary to enter the _Host_ and the _IP address_ where you domain will point. **Firebase** proposes to use the domain's name as _Host_, for example `diegofrayo.com`. I **didn't** use my domain's name as _Host_, instead, I used the `@` symbol\n\n   <ImageWithLink\n   \tsrc={DATA.post.assets.images[\"1\"]}\n   \talt=\"Creating a A record\"\n   \twidth={698}\n   \theight={190}\n   />\n\n   The domain's configuration on **Go Daddy** should look like this:\n\n   <ImageWithLink\n   \tsrc={DATA.post.assets.images[\"2\"]}\n   \talt=\"The domain's configuration\"\n   \twidth={698}\n   \theight={371}\n   />\n\n1. Now, you should wait a couple of hours until the changes take effect _(I waited for around 4 hours)_. After this, you will have the **Go Daddy** domain connected with your **Firebase** project\n\n## Deploying our website on Firebase Hosting\n\nTo deploy our website on **Firebase Hosting**, let's follow the next steps:\n\n1. Install **firebase-tools:** `npm install -g firebase-tools`\n\n1. Create a folder for our project and init it\n\n   ```bash\n   mkdir project-name\n   cd project-name\n   firebase init\n   ```\n\n   > When you execute the third command, you have to sign in using your **Google** Account\n\n1. Now, your project should have the next structure:\n\n   <ImageWithLink\n   \tsrc={DATA.post.assets.images[\"3\"]}\n   \talt=\"Our project's structure\"\n   \twidth={268}\n   \theight={366}\n   />\n\n   Inside of `public` folder we must store all website's assets. The `firebase.json` file should look like this:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n   \t\"hosting\": {\n   \t\t\"public\": \"public\",\n   \t\t\"ignore\": [\"firebase.json\", \"**/.*\", \"**/node_modules/**\"]\n   \t}\n   }\n   ```\n\n   > In adition, we can configure more things in this file, for example, redirections, rewrites and other interesting stuff. In this [link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config?authuser=0) you can read more about this configuration file\n\n1. To test the website on your local environment, you can use `firebase serve` command, it creates a HTTP server and you can access it via [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)\n\n1. To deploy the website on **Firebase Hosting**, just execute `firebase deploy` command\n\n## Final words\n\nWhen you are creating the **A and TXT records** on **Go Daddy**, it's important to be patient and wait until the changes take effect, it could take a couple of hours. As you have seen, using **Firebase Hosting** you can deploy a website easily, besides getting an SSL certificate for free. I hope this tutorial has been useful for you, thanks for reading.\n"}
