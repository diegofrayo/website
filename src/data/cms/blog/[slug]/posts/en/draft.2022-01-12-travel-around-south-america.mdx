Hi there, after over 3 years ago, I feel like to write about a trip I made around South America.

The main reason is practice English again (writting skills) and remember a bit that amazing experience for my life

So, here we go

## Before start the travel

I think one of the main reasons to take the desiccion to travel was music. In that time, Music was becoming in one of my biggest hobbies and passions, I was learning to play guitar, every day I discovered new songs, artists and music styles and one artist blow my mind, Silvio Rodríguez.
During a couple of months I became a big fan of Silvio Rodríguez music, I liked his poetry, sensibility, rebeldia, simpleza and many more qualities that I saw in his music. He was a big inspiration to keep learning to play guitar, though I have to admit two things, I'm not close to play the guitar like him and the song that motivated myself to play guitar is this [one]().

Another important reason to decide to travel was my college degree. Getting my degree took me long time, around 3 years, It was a stressfull situation for me and my family, It was a mess, I don't like to remember that. So, when finally I could finish my tesis, I felt that was the moment to live new experiencies and traveling was a amazing, unknown and challeging experience for me.

Coming back to the music reason, I knew that Silvio Rodríguez was going to offer a concerts tour in some countries of South America, I felt it was the perfect and maybe the only chhance that I had to go to a concert of him, so, I decided to travel to Argentina to assist a one of its concerts in Rosario city.

Getting my degree took me long time, around 3 years, It was a stressful situation for me, what a mess!, I don't want to extend about this. So, when I could finish my thesis finally, I felt that was the moment to live new experiences and “traveling” would be an amazing, unknown and challenging experience for me.

## The initial plan

My initial idea was visit Argentina and its 3 main cities, Rosario, Cordoba and Buenos Aires. I didn’t know enough about Argentina and its amazing touristic places like the Patagonia or its several beautiful cities located at North side. When I realized that the journey was long for my opinion, I thought It would be cool to visit Peru also, taking advantage of it was close from Argentina. So, I decided to stay 3 weeks in Argentina and stay all december in Peru, first in Lima and then Cusco. The trip just was going to last 2 months.

## Timeline of this trip

Finally, This trip ends up 4 months instead of 2, my plans changed when I was in Cusco, close to finish the trip.
