INTRO: Am C G D x 4   (x2)


Am      C
 Oh so, your weak rhyme
    G                 D
You doubt I'll bother reading into it
     Am
I probably won't
     C
Left to my own devices
    G                     D
But that's the difference in our opinions

Am
 You're a mouthful
C                 G                  D
 That amounts for another week on my own
  Am            C
Now I'm a novel made resourceful
 G                      D
I start a chain with my thought


Am      Am        C
Talk is cheap, my darling
            G                D
When you're feeling right at home
        Am                 C
I wanna make you move with confidence
        G            D
I wanna be with you alone

     Am               C
Said help me help you start it
          G               D
You're too comfortable to know
Am                 C
Throwing out those words
            G                 D
Oh, you gotta feel it on your own



INTRO   (x2)


Am
 Cold pain
  C
I cannot sustain it
G
  That's what I'm thinking
D
  Not what I'm drinking
  Am
I hold up my ways
      C
These thoughts are pervasive
G
  It's not a statement
D
But peace can be evasive

Am
 You're a mouthful
C                 G                  D
 That amounts for another week on my own
  Am            C
Now I'm a novel made resourceful
 G                      D
I start a chain with my thought


Am      Am        C
Talk is cheap, my darling
            G                D
When you're feeling right at home
        Am                 C
I wanna make you move with confidence
        G            D
I wanna be with you alone

     Am               C

Oh, you gotta feel it on your own
