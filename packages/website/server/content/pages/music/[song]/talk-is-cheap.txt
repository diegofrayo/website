INTRO: Am / C / G / D   (x4)


Am        C
   Oh so, You are weak or I am
G                          D
   You doubt I'll bother       reading into it
     Am
I probably won't
        C
left to my own devices
G                              D
   but that's the difference      in our opinions

Am
   You're a mouthful
C                    G                     D
   that amounts for     another week on my own
Am                  C
   now I'm a novel     made resourceful
G                          D
   I start a chain with my thought


Am      Am        C
talk is cheap, my darling
            G                D
when You're feeling right at home
        Am                 C
I wanna make you move with confidence
        G            D
I wanna be with you alone

     Am               C
said help me help you start it
           G               D
You're too comfortable to know
Am                 C
throwing out those words
              G               D
Oh, you gotta feel it on your own



INTRO   (x2)


Am
   cold pain
  C
I cannot sustain it
G
   that's what I'm thinking
D
   not what I'm drinking

  Am
I hold up my ways
      C
these thoughts are pervasive
G
   It's not a statement
    D
but peace can be evasive

Am
   You're a mouthful
C                    G                     D
   that amounts for     another week on my own
